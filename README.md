# DARSI (Deep Learning Adaptable Regulatory Sequence Identifier) Package  

The DARSI package trains Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for MPRA (Massively Parallel Reporter Assays) datasets. The trained models predict expression levels from raw DNA sequences and generate saliency maps for each trained model to predict binding site locations. This README file introduces the scripts and how they can be used. For more comprehensive guidance, please see the comments in each of the scripts.

## How to Install the DARSI Package

The DARSI package can be easily installed by cloning the repository to your local machine. Run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/armankarshenas/DARSI
```


## How to Use the DARSI Package

The DARSI package is designed to work with MPRA datasets that consist of thousands of mutated DNA sequences and corresponding gene expression activity measurements. The processed data is used to train a CNN for each gene/operon in the dataset, and the trained model is then used to:

- Predict expression activity for *de-novo* sequences.
- Generate saliency maps and expression shifts to identify binding sites.

The `DARSI.sh` script is the primary interface for using this pipeline. It automates the following steps:

1. Preprocessing the data.
2. Training CNN models.
3. Generating saliency maps.
4. Identifying binding sites in the dataset.

|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------------|
| `-i`          | Path to the input MPRA data (CSV/Excel file)                  | Yes      | N/A              |
| `-s`          | Path to save the output files                                 | No       | Current directory |
| `-m`      | Path to save image outputs (e.g., saliency maps)              | No       | None             |
| `-h`          | Path to save histogram outputs                                | No       | None             |

## Example Usage

To run the pipeline with all options:

```bash
./DARSI.sh -i ~/Desktop/DARSI/data/input_data.csv -s ~/Desktop/DARSI/output -m ~/Desktop/DARSI/images -h ~/Desktop/DARSI/histograms -l 20000 -t 0.8 -e 0.1
```

To run the pipeline with only the input data:

```bash
./DARSI.sh -i ~/Desktop/DARSI/data/input_data.csv
```

## Preprocessing

Before training the network, sequences need to be converted into binary images and expression levels must be binned into discrete classes. The following script performs this processing:

- **SequenceDataProcessing.m** â€“ Converts sequences into binary images and bins expression levels.

## CNN Training

The CNN models can be trained using the following script:

- **trainGeneSpecificCNN.m** - Trains a CNN for each operon in the dataset with the processed data generated by the pre-processing steps


## Saliency Map Generation & Binding Site Identification

To generate saliency maps and identify binding sites, run the following scripts in order:

1. **saliencyMapGenerator.m**
2. **findBindingSites.m**
