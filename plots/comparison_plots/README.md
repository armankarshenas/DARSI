## Distribution of the mRNA Counts 
---

This directory contains figures illustrating the distribution of $\log(\text{normalized mRNA count})$ for the analyzed operons. Each figure visualizes the distribution of expression values along with the assigned gene expression bin (zero, low, or high) for every data point. 

### Key Details:
- The $\log(\text{normalized mRNA count})$ is calculated to normalize the wide range of expression values, enabling clearer visualization and comparison across the dataset.  
- Gene expression bins are assigned based on thresholds derived from the distribution of the normalized counts, categorizing the data into distinct expression levels (zero, low, and high).  

### Important Note:
While the figures may show overlap between low and high expression bins, this is purely an artifact of histogram binning used for visualization purposes. It does **not** indicate an actual overlap in the underlying expression classes.

### Usage:
These figures are intended to provide an overview of the expression data distribution for quality control and exploratory analysis. Researchers can use this information to evaluate the suitability of the binning strategy and its alignment with downstream modeling objectives.
