# RNA-Seq Data Processing 
---
This directory contains scripts that can be used to generated tables of variant sequences and their corresponding RNA_count from raw RNA-Seq data. We advise that these scripts are used before the main repo is used to ensure that the sequence files generated have the same formatting as the ones used by the scripts in the main repo. 


## Requirements
For quality filtering [`fastp`](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) is required (version 0.23.2 was used).
